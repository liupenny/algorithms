------

Find all possible combinations of **\*k*** numbers that add up to a number **\*n***, given that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.

**Note:**

- All numbers will be positive integers.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: k = 3, n = 9
Output: [[1,2,6], [1,3,5], [2,3,4]]
```
