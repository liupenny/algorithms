------

Given an array of **n** positive integers and a positive integer **s**, find the minimal length of a **contiguous** subarray of which the sum ≥ **s**. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

**Example:** 

```
Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
```
