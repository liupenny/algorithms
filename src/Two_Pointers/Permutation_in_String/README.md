------

Given two strings **s1** and **s2**, write a function to return true if **s2** contains the permutation of **s1**. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the **substring** of the second string. 

**Example 1:**

```
Input:s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output:True
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:s1= "ab" s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: False
```
