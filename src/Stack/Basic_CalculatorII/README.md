------

Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only **non-negative** integers, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators and empty spaces ``. The integer division should truncate toward zero.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "3+2*2"
Output: 7
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: " 3/2 "
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5
```

**Note:**

- You may assume that the given expression is always valid.
- **Do not** use the `eval` built-in library function.
