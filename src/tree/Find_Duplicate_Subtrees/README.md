------

Given a binary tree, return all duplicate subtrees. For each kind of duplicate subtrees, you only need to return the root node of any **one** of them.

Two trees are duplicate if they have the same structure with same node values.

**Example 1:**

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     /   / \
    4   2   4
       /
      4
```

The following are two duplicate subtrees:

```
      2
     /
    4
```

and

```
    4
```
