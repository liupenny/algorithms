------

Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.

**Note:** The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

**Example 1:**

Input:

```
              5
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          1   1   5
```

Output:

```
2
```

**Example 2:**

Input:

```
              1
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          4   4   5
```

Output:

```
