Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices *i* and *j* in the array such that the **absolute**difference between **nums[i]** and **nums[j]** is at most *t* and the **absolute** difference between *i* and *j* is at most *k*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,1], k = 4, t = 0
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 0
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [4,2], k = 2, t = 1 
Output: false
